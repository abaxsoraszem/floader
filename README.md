# What does this do
The tool creates X accounts, and generates Y random transactions against these accounts. See `application.yaml` for config details.


A transaction is 

```json
{"transactionId":"32399c82-41c5-4edc-b81a-1758e849e014","transactionType":"DEBIT","iban":"DE123456785068416","amount":1032.14,"currency":"JPY","remittenceInfo":"raspberry raspberry kiwi"}
```

It uses Spring Integration to achieve this. 

Input channel is subscribed by 3 consumers
* console logger
* file logger
* gcp pubsub sink

See `spring-integration-config.xml` to toggle subscribers on an off.

# How to test without PubSub

`mvn spring-boot:run` will run without GCP publishing.

# How to run with PubSub

## Create PubSub topic
```bash
gcloud services enable batch.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com
gcloud pubsub topics create transactions
```

## Get the IAM service account access token

Create a Service Account in Google Cloud Console


Google Cloud IAM & Admin.
Select Your Project (or create a new one if needed).
Click "Create Service Account".
Enter a Name & Description (e.g., pubsub-service-account).
Click "Create and Continue".


Assign Pub/Sub Permissions.
Under Grant access, choose:
Role: Pub/Sub Publisher (to allow publishing messages).
(Optional) Add Pub/Sub Subscriber if you also need to receive messages.
Click "Continue".
Click "Done".


Generate a JSON Key.
Find the new service account in the Service Accounts list.
Click on it and go to the "Keys" tab.
Click "Add Key" â†’ "Create new key".
Select "JSON", then click "Create".
The JSON key file will be downloaded to your computer (save it as ./service-account-key.json).

## Activate the GcpPublisher

Uncomment GCP  in pom.xml
```xml
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-integration</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<!-- Spring Integration GCP Pub/Sub -->
		<!-- <dependency>
			<groupId>com.google.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-gcp-starter-pubsub</artifactId>
		</dependency> -->
```

and in java code
```java
// @Configuration
public class GcpPublisher {
```

Enable the GCP part in `application.yaml`
```yaml
spring:
...
  cloud:
    gcp:
      pubsub:
        enabled: true
        project-id: YOURPROJECT
        credentials:
          location: file:service-account-key.json
```



Now `mvn spring-boot:run` will now run WITH GCP publishing.
